Dear reader,
<br/>
Here is our github repository with our datafiles for the funda business case. <br/>
Here below we have a link for the funda.csv file we have used to make our EDA and modelling notebooks. We also have the link with the csv files generated as outcomes of our EDA after cleaning the data and applying topic modelling.<br/>
